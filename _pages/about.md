Welcome! I'm a second-year master student at UC San Diego, working with [Prof. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/). My research focuses on the intersection of personalization and NLP. I'm also broadly interested in language technology for user-facing systems.

I did my undergraduate study at UC Irvine, where I worked on robustness and interpretability in NLP with [Prof. Sameer Singh](https://sameersingh.org/).
