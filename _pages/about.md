Welcome! I'm a first-year master student at UC San Diego, working on personalized language generation with [Prof. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/). I did my undergraduate study at UC Irvine, where I worked on adversarial attacks in NLP with [prof. Sameer Singh](https://sameersingh.org/). My research explores applied NLP and robustness/interpretability of machine learning models.
